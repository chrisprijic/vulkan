# Vulkan

This repo documents my process going through the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) website.

I plan to use this to reach a point in:

* understanding Vulkan and how to use it
* additional comments and details
* additional experiments and features I want to try out in Vulkan

## Future Goals

I am working on games/game rendering tech, and I want to have a solid understanding of Vulkan before I 
try to abstract it's features.

Process:

[x] setup
[x] instance

[ ] fixed functions
[ ] render passes
[ ] framebuffers
[ ] command buffers
[ ] rendering and presentation
