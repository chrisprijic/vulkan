# Vulkan

This repo documents my process going through the [Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) website.

I plan to use this to reach a point in:

* understanding Vulkan and how to use it
* additional comments and details
* additional experiments and features I want to try out in Vulkan

## Future Goals

I am working on games/game rendering tech, and I want to have a solid understanding of Vulkan before I 
try to abstract it's features.

Process:

- [x] setup
- [x] instance
- [x] validation and debugging
- [x] physical devices and queues
- [x] logical devices and queues
- [x] window surface and present queue
- [x] swapchain
- [x] image views
- [x] shaders
- [x] fixed functions
- [x] render passes
- [x] finished graphics pipeline
- [x] framebuffers
- [x] command buffers
- [ ] rendering and presentation

At this point, we've got a rendered triangle on the screen:

- [ ] swapchain recreation
- [ ] vertex input
- [ ] vertex buffers
- [ ] staging buffers
- [ ] index buffers
- [ ] descriptor data
- [ ] descriptor management
- [ ] images
- [ ] image view & samplers
- [ ] combined image samplers
- [ ] depth buffering
- [ ] models
- [ ] mipmaps
- [ ] multisampling
